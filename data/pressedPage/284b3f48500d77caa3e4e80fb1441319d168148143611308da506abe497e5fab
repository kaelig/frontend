As soon as the Stone Roses’ 1990 bank holiday show was announced, everyone agreed that it already sounded legendary. In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p><p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, 'That's a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.' Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p><p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p><p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: 'What's that?' 'Just hold it in your hand,' I said, 'and all the journalists next week will be saying you've got the whole world in your hand.' And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p><p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p><p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p><p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p><p>Adamski goes to number one with 'Killer' on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p><p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p><p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during 'Like a Virgin' on her 'Blond Ambition' tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p><p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p><p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon's offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads 'Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick', in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback, 27 May 1990: The

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1448461571000,"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

His voice remains terrific in its warmth, technical assurance and expressive range, and his performance as Tchaikovsky’s tragically deluded hero is exceptional even by his own high standards.</p><figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"04edc01b4f024b27b27c9200c4ce67f2c027896e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/04edc01b4f024b27b27c9200c4ce67f2c027896e/0_305_2856_3687/775.jpg\" alt=\"Terrific warmth … Hvorostovsky.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terrific warmth … Hvorostovsky.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Eugene Onegin review – hero's welcome for exceptional Hvorostovsky","lastModified":1450701675527,"standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London</strong><br>Singing between courses of cancer treatment, the baritone was charismatic and provocative in a cast that transcended Kasper Holten’s confused production</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f93e","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/opera","url":"/music/opera","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Opera","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/opera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

It’s deceptively simple, with a steady kick, a ticking snare, and a synth line spiking and falling within a single key. The claps though, offbeat and untamed, maintain a crucial edge of mania.

/></strong>Mainly on my iPhone or computer, with headphones. I’m remarkably hopeless when it comes to hi-fi equipment, despite working so much with a world-leading company in this field. I suppose headphones are better for a life that is almost always on the move – and when I often have to concentrate on something within a very noisy family environment.</p><p><strong>What was the first ever record or CD that you bought? <br /></strong>It was a late-60s compilation of organ music by EMI called The King of Instruments. I went out of my way to learn these pieces as soon as I could, and they are almost etched on my mind: Widor’s Toccata, Bach’s Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, followed by Buxtehude’s Preludium in G minor. In fact I can’t hear Purcell’s Voluntary on the Old 100th without thinking of George Thalben Ball’s slightly clumsy trill at the beginning of the second section.</p>","linkText":"Facing the music:

underground band’s following has grown in a way they never would have anticipated. This is evident from their triumphant reformation at <a href=\"http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/04/the-10-best-moments-from-coachella-2012.html\">Coachella in 2012</a> and traces of their seminal album The Shape Of Punk To Come lurking within much of modern punk music. And let’s not forget their militant <a href=\"http://www.aux.tv/2013/04/qa-refused-on-the-prophecy-of-the-shape-of-punk-to-come/\">stance on veganism</a>, which lives on within the dietary requirements of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/02/beyonce-vegan-food-service-celebrity-trend\">Beyonc&eacute; and Lil B</a>. Big fans of the Scandinavian post-hardcore scene, apparently.</p><p>It makes sense, then, to return with a full album. In <a href=\"http://epitaph.com/artists/refused\">Freedom</a>, out on 30 June, the youthful exuberance of “full-on anarchist jargon” is gone, and in its place are songs inspired by time spent “talking about politics, existential issues and what we wanted to present as a band in 2015,” says vocalist Dennis Lyxz&eacute;n. “We talked about the political situation in Europe, capitalism and how it affects people.”</p>","linkText":"Listen to Refused's new track Françafrique","lastModified":1432631022000,"standfirst":"<p>Premiered ahead of new album Freedom, the Swedish punk band ditch anarchist

Phillips is a bit of an outsider, even a solipsist, who writes, produces and performs all of his songs, tracking each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel. According to his forthcoming single - We Try But We Don’t Fit In - isolation is getting to him: he has even got a song, Nothing at All, that finds him moaning “What am I good for?”, answering himself: “Nothing at all”.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","linkText":"The playlist: new bands – Day Wave, Boycrush, Rangleklods and more","lastModified":1432566679000,"standfirst":"<p>Lo-fi synth angst from Day Wave, Sunflower Bean hear voices, and Boycrush ft Madeira wreak lovely, summery electro fluff </p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497g4","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/indie","url":"/music/indie","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/paullester","url":"/profile/paullester","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Paul Lester","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paullester","bio":"<p>Paul Lester been contributing to the Guardian for most of this century.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br /></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited. Dirty rhythm, indeed! <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p>","linkText":"Summer jams: Guardian critics pick the songs that will soundtrack your holidays","lastModified":1432318379558,"standfirst":"<p>As the perennial debate begins over which songs will own the summer, our critics chime in with their favourites – and find mobile phones, yoga and polyamorous relationships are the big themes this year</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494kh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/nicki-minaj","url":"/music/nicki-minaj","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Nicki Minaj","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/janelle-monae","url":"/music/janelle-monae","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Janelle Monae","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/david-guetta","url":"/music/david-guetta","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"David Guetta","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/david-guetta","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/rob-le-donne","url":"/profile/rob-le-donne","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Rob LeDonne","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-le-donne","twitterHandle":"robledonne","bio":"<p>Rob LeDonne is a freelance journalist and comedy writer.</p>","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-hutchinson","url":"/profile/kate-hutchinson","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Hutchinson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson","twitterHandle":"katehutchinson","bio":"<p>Kate Hutchinson is deputy editor of the Guide.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","linkText":"The playlist: pop – Emmi, Little Mix, PYCO and more","lastModified":1432420063000,"standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4962p","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","url":"/profile/michaelcragg","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Mind</h2><p>Reluctant figureheads for a post-millennial US metal scene that has singularly failed to live up to their standards, Killswitch Engage return in 2016 with an album that promises to be one of the year’s most significant. The band’s second album since the return of vocalist Jesse Leach in 2012, it needs to be brilliant for all concerned, but even at their most pedestrian Killswitch exude a passion and belief in what they’re doing that, while occasionally a little too earnest for we cynical Brits, is as endearing as it is believable. Strength Of The Mind suggests that high expectations could well be met this time round. It’s a huge, groove-driven modern heavy metal anthem with a big but gritty chorus and subtly inventive riffs by the score: prime Killswitch, in other words.

But as conversations between jazz, classical music and pop have grown ever more fluent, Mehldau’s eclecticism has turned him into a major star. He rammed the reasons home this week in an unaccompanied performance split between respectfully straight recitals of several JS Bach classics, and densely dazzling compositions and improvisations inspired by them. The show was a new venture for him called Three Pieces After Bach, <a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/brad-mehldau-201512171930\">co-commissioned</a> by Carnegie Hall, Wigmore and others. <br /></p><p>A relaxed, cowboy-shirted Mehldau opened with the G minor Fugue No 16 expressed through more dynamic swerves and percussive chord work than a Bach purist might favour, but as the gig progressed, the pianist cherished the original subjects of these pieces with a growing clarity. The C major Prelude from Well-Tempered Clavier Book 2 led him toward a deep rhythmic thunder built out of the source’s serene pulse, then a turmoil of interwoven melodies and hints of blues. </p>","linkText":"Brad Mehldau review – a balance of space and intensity perfectly struck","lastModified":1450461525000,"standfirst":"<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br>A dense and dazzling recital of Bach’s classics and the compositions and improvisations inspired by them makes this a powerful, thought-provoking gig</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f7jh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/brad-mehldau","url":"/music/brad-mehldau","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Brad Mehldau","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/brad-mehldau","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/jazz","url":"/music/jazz","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Jazz","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/johnfordham","url":"/profile/johnfordham","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"John Fordham","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnfordham","bio":"<p>John Fordham is the Guardian's main jazz critic.

Fellow Swede G&ouml;sta Nystroem’s atmospheric 1934 prelude The Tempest, inspired by Shakespeare, wasted no time on the preamble of a brewing storm, whipping straight into the teeth of a gale. The music only rested briefly in the calm eye of the storm before more gale – the Hoddinott Hall audience had a buffeting.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ondine.net/?cid=4.2&amp;oid=622\">Einojuhani Rautavaara</a>’s Cantus Arcticus featured the composer’s own recordings of Finnish marsh and sea birds that become the concertante element in his three-movement suite. For all the often stark beauty of their calls in wraparound sound, the effect of the disjuncture between the birds’ aural presence and their absence, there-but-not-there, was slightly surreal. Central to Rautavaara’s philosophy is the mystic experience: this was sometimes less mystic than disconcerting.</p>","linkText":"BBCNOW/Andersson review – potent dramatic

Christmas Oratorio by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/l-ospedale-review-comic-opera-solomons-knot\">Solomon’s Knot</a>, the final event of the <a href=\"http://www.spitalfieldsmusic.org.uk/whats-on/winter-festival-2015/\">Spitalfields Music winter festival</a>. It was, admittedly, unusual: there was no conductor, and the singers performed the whole thing from memory. Moreover, it was unflaggingly engaging and direct.</p><p> Solomon’s Knot are a young baroque group who make a point of being a collective, and whose desire to engage with their audience on this occasion extended to the co-artistic director <a href=\"http://jonathansells.co.uk/Profile.html\">Jonathan Sells</a> telling us where they were going to go drinking afterwards. Sells was one of two bass soloists; there were eight singers in all, sitting or standing in front of the instrumental ensemble and, to some small extent, interacting – though deeming it “dramatisation” when people in concert frocks took occasional steps and looked at each other or the audience was stretching things.</p>","linkText":"Christmas Oratorio review – Bach from memory

\n</aside><p>When the soundtrack to Empire entered the US charts at No 1 in March, no one could have been particularly surprised, with one possible exception: Madonna, who unexpectedly found herself debuting at No 2. All that effort promoting your new album – the interviews, the online courting of controversy, unceremoniously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/madonna-falls-but-it-was-the-brit-awards-that-took-a-tumble\">falling on your arse at the Brits</a> – and you’re pipped at the post by one of the oldest tricks in the book, the one that Micky Dolenz of the Monkees famously described as “the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan”.

of songs hanging their hooks out on massive guitar lines, this terrific debut album sounds like a forgotten underground classic from 1989","body":"<p>In a year when several young bands – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/dilly-dally-sore-review-album-toronto-indie-punks\">Dilly Dally</a>, Bully and others – attempt to revive the corpse of loud, punky, alt-rock, the Philadelphia quartet Beach Slang were streets ahead of the competition. They’re an unlikely proposition: the usual twentysomethings fronted by a fortysomething, James Alex, who – rather like Guided By Voices’ similarly late-starting frontman Robert Pollard – sounds as if he’s willing himself into the role. That he succeeds is down to the quality of the songs: Beach Slang’s debut album sounds like a forgotten underground classic from 1989 or 1990, every song hanging its hooks out on massive guitar lines. It’s an indie record, yet it sounds huge – and not in an overbearing way. Too Late to Die Young strays a little into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/the-gaslight-anthem\">Gaslight Anthem</a> territory, with Alex complaining about how he “ain’t never felt love” and romanticising the punks, but the change of pace is necessary on an album whose principal interest is in pinning the listener to the wall. </p><figure class=\"element element-embed\"

Zealander Nadia Reid’s indie-soul debut album is a charming, assured treat","body":"<p>It took 24-year-old New Zealander <a href=\"https://nadiareid.bandcamp.com/\">Nadia Reid</a> seven years to write the songs for her first album, because “I wasn’t sure how to begin, or if I had it in me.” But this doesn’t sound like an album troubled by musical doubt; Reid’s touch is sure throughout, as is her judgment. Her palette isn’t broad, but it’s expertly deployed – on the modal folk of Call the Days, she’s reminiscent of Laura Marling; on Reaching Through, a full band gives her a bit of Teenage Fanclubesque oomph (like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/13/angel-olsen-burn-your-fire-review\">Angel Olsen</a>, she’s adept at switching from introspective and soft to loud and rocking); Just to Feel Alive is the kind of indie soul ballad that Matthew E White’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/inside-the-spacebomb-studio-with-natalie-prass-and-matthew-e-white\">Spacebomb collective</a> specialise in. Reid’s voice is wistful and reflective, sometimes blurring the syllables, and it gives this startlingly good debut a feeling of warmth, a welcoming Aga in the musical kitchen.</p><figure

debut from this Irish four-piece howls at you from the very start, an unbroken series of thumping, crashing songs strewn with fractured, imagistic lyrics. Singer Dara Kiely has talked about his struggles with mental health, and it is tempting to layer biography over these nine songs, which veer wildly from industrial shocks to math-rock repetition, and place punkish howls alongside minimal-techno impulses. The lyrics could echo the screeds of a midnight drunk or the interior meanderings of&nbsp;fellow Dubliner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/15/bloomsday-fans-around-the-world-celebrating-james-joyces-ulysses\">Leopold Bloom</a>: “Creeped into an exit / He’ll have it for breakfast / Said crawl on your knees / And tasting the freshest” runs a line from Fucking Butter. While the album is unpredictable, it is never chaotic: just as you think things might spiral out of&nbsp;control there is a pause, or a change of tempo or phrasing. It&nbsp;has the feeling of a splint being applied to a broken limb, or the force of will stopping the mind from turning feverish. It’s an album on which struggle is audible.</p>","linkText":"Girl Band: Holding Hands with Jamie review – thumping, crashing sound and fury from Dublin punks","lastModified":1450461434000,"standfirst":"<p>(Rough Trade)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f5zb","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","url":"/music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The albums we missed in 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/punk","url":"/music/punk","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Punk","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/punk","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/indie","url":"/music/indie","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/paulmacinnes","url":"/profile/paulmacinnes","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulmacinnes","bio":"<p>Paul MacInnes is the editor of the Guide.

London quintet concern themselves with the twilight natural world, wrapped up in warm brass and the glowing valves of vintage synths","body":"<p><br />The crepuscular songs on the debut album of London quintet the Leaf Library are typically set outdoors on the coast of southern England, and involve gazing in melancholy wonder at the world. Their lyrics are concerned with time’s repetitions, the movement of the seasons, the rhythms of night and day, and there’s circular motion, too, in the way the spare verses are repeated like mantras. “Seas turn white / By October light / swim away from the summer sun,” sings Kate Gibson softly on the melancholic <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theleaflibrary.bandcamp.com/track/pushing-swimming\">Pushing/Swimming</a>. There’s further repetition in the music itself, whether the Stereolab-like motorik pop of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theleaflibrary.bandcamp.com/track/asleep-between-stations\">Asleep Between Stations</a>, or the rippling acoustic patterns of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theleaflibrary.bandcamp.com/track/acre\">Acre</a>. It’s easy to get lost in the woozy ebb and flow of the twinkling arpeggios of <a href=\"https://theleaflibrary.bandcamp.com/track/Rings-of-Saturn\">Rings of Saturn</a>, named after WG Sebald’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/aug/13/the-rings-of-saturn-by-wg-sebald-walking-through-history\">East Anglia travelogue</a>. The arrangements are never fussy, but there are some delightful touches, with warm horns bursting from the vintage synths like the first rays of dawn.</p>","linkText":"Daylight Versions: the Leaf

We know what to expect by now – scratchy, lo-fi punk and croaky anti-folk – yet we also know his lyrical wit still has the capacity to surprise. Outta Town is a perfect example, a Cribsesque love song that appears at first to conform to standard tropes – “Is it Friday, is it Monday, I can’t tell without you?” – but it transpires that Lewis’s lover hasn’t left him; she has just gone to visit her mum for a couple of days, leaving him to confront the fact that he’s barely able to look after himself: “The recycling starts to pile up and smell without you.” Elsewhere he wrestles with neighbourhood crackheads, the pressures of settling down and – who else could tackle this? – the stress of having to pay your drummer on support tours. Lewis is unlikely to ever dramatically change; instead his music slowly develops and wizens, as we all do. It’ll be fun growing old with him.</p>","linkText":"Jeffrey Lewis & Los Bolts: Manhattan review – anti-folk star still capable of surprises","lastModified":1450461430000,"standfirst":"<p>(Rough Trade) </p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f6v8","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","url":"/music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The albums we missed in 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/indie","url":"/music/indie","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timjonze","url":"/profile/timjonze","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Jonze","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timjonze","twitterHandle":"timjonze","bio":"<p>Tim Jonze is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music\">music editor</a> of guardian.co.uk.

Luckily they stuck it out. On this third album of beautifully crafted, genre-defying R&amp;B-soul, Martian and fellow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/15/odd-future-woke-up-one-morning\">Odd Future</a> producer Syd tha Kyd – plus musicians Patrick Paige II, Christopher Allan Smith, Jameel Bruner and Steve Lacy – have moved on from the cosmic soul and drug-referencing jams of their 2011 debut, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/02/the-internet-purple-naked-ladies-review\">Purple Naked Ladies</a>, to&nbsp;Ego Death’s Grammy-nominated, groove-led musings on love and lust. Syd sounds more confident than ever, weaving her shimmery voice over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32HJ7PHnKY\">Get Away</a>’s funk-tinged bassline, reflecting on being sought out by a woman who reckons Syd’s fame has brought in some serious cash, when in fact Syd is driving her old car and “still living at home”. There’s wit and honesty behind her observations of courting and heartbreak, making her pinhole focus on love more about nuance than navel-gazing. It’s just as well the band stayed together.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32HJ7PHnKY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z32HJ7PHnKY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure>","linkText":"The Internet: Ego Death review – Odd Future offshoot muse on love and lust","lastModified":1450461430000,"standfirst":"<p>(Odd Future)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4f5kj","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all","url":"/music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","url":"/music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The albums we missed in 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-albums-we-missed-in-2015","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/rap","url":"/music/rap","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Rap","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/hip-hop","url":"/music/hip-hop","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Hip-hop","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/tshepo-mokoena","url":"/profile/tshepo-mokoena","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tshepo Mokoena","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tshepo-mokoena","twitterHandle":"tnm___","bio":"<p>Tshepo Mokoena is a music journalist, blogger and video editor.

current name, Movement Electronic Music Festival celebrates its biggest year yet, with 141 artists across six stages at Hart Plaza.

getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","linkText":"Why Ezra Furman is the most compelling live act you can see right now","lastModified":1432420063000,"standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of performer who

Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear schlocky soft rock on a sound system as the island’s dancehall stars","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

communities, of the Big Noise schemes in Stirling’s Raploch and Glasgow’s Govanhill, show positive outcomes across the board. These range from better school attendance to projected whole-life benefits for participants, such as greater community cohesion as well as economic gains over the medium and longer term. The high initial cost of delivering the scheme should be offset by the savings that are projected to accrue from longer-term improved health and educational outcomes. </p><p>It’s a tribute to Sistema Scotland’s political, as well as social, reach that the report’s findings are endorsed by Scotland’s culture minister Fiona Hyslop, who supports its “potential to transform lives and tackle inequalities”, although she stops short of recommending that it be rolled out across more than the three communities in which it will be working later this year (the project in Torry, in Aberdeen, will start in the summer).</p>","linkText":"El Sistema Scotland: Positive outcomes across the board","lastModified":1432118790248,"standfirst":"<p>The first report into the two Big Noise schemes in

It’s deceptively simple, with a steady kick, a ticking snare, and a synth line spiking and falling within a single key. The claps though, offbeat and untamed, maintain a crucial edge of mania. It’s so beautiful I can hardly bear it, and scrunch up my face in a kind of pain when it’s on – the kind of embarrassingly keen feeling that age will hopefully never wither.</p>","linkText":"The

She arrived at the Hospital Tenon in the 20th arrondissement of Paris on 19 December, though according to her own version of events, she was delivered on the front steps of her home at 72 Rue de Belleville after a horse-drawn ambulance failed to show. If this was fanciful, then France’s most legendary chanteuse didn’t have to embellish the details of the rest of her life, such was the dramatic scope. From growing up in a bordello, to spending four years blinded by keratitis in her infancy, to joining her acrobat father on the road in her teens, to shooting up morphine, cortisone and falling into alcoholism to alleviate a dodgy back sustained in a car crash as an adult (precipitating what she described as her “years of hell”), it certainly wasn’t without event.</p><p>While celebrations for Piaf’s centenary have been low key this December, France – and the Belleville neighbourhood of Paris in particular – honoured her memory following the 50th anniversary of her death in October 2013. If Piaf is a little out of fashion with today’s jeunesse dor&eacute;e then you suspect that could all change at any moment with, say, a high-profile cover version or a new motion picture. To paraphrase an old footballing cliche, fashion is temporary, class is permanent. Her brand of torch songs and cabaret showtunes might seem antediluvian to some, but a voice with such power to convey emotion never dates. What’s more, she led a life so bohemian and wild that she makes the Jim Morrison – buried, like her, on P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery – look like a calculable conformist who got a bit carried away on his gap year.

That’s why they sing them in languages you probably never learned. If they sang them in English you’d be angry rather than baffled. Plus all opera companies have, for some reason, too many costumes and are thus always looking to fast-track operas with scope for costume changes and extensive cross-dressing. It also explains why there’s always an aria in which a moustache-twirling, straight Lothario questions his sexuality after falling for a new lad in uniform and why, for plot reasons that make no sense, he has to go undercover as a milkmaid in act two, even though the bloke who plays him weighs 120kg and was once a prop forward for Llanelli Rugby Football Club. </p><p>No wonder, in such circumstances, that a Times classical music critic confessed earlier this year to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/16/mozart-marriage-of-figaro-can-you-explain-the-plot\">still not understanding the plot of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro</a>. To help him, and perhaps you, understand the incomprehensible, here are some opera synopses simplified, with a festive nod towards Giodarno’s Andrea Ch&eacute;nier – because the BBC is going to be showing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06sg8s6\">David McVicar’s Covent Garden production on Friday 18 December</a>. The last thing I want this festive season is for Guardian readers to settle down to watch tenor Jonas Kaufmann sing the title role, stupidly mystified by the story.

And reminding us mountains are usually twinned with deep valleys. Yet, hailing from Tennessee, and regularly retreating to a remote mountain cabin to inspire creativity, Parton’s talent for songwriting has often been overlooked – “not many people knew I came out of the smoky mountains with a load of songs”. But her admirers come from all quarters. Queen Latifah said: “Let’s be clear. Dolly Parton is a rapper. Somewhere before all the country. I don’t know what happens up there in the mountains when you’re growing up, but she has been spitting rhymes for a long time.”</p><figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5f0d54ced952e786ed6bd081dea463528b6ba5\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dc5f0d54ced952e786ed6bd081dea463528b6ba5/100_74_3447_5163/668.jpg\" alt=\"Dolly Parton.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dolly Parton.

Generally, though, picking out great pop years is a subjective pub game. David Hepworth has <a href=\"http://whatsheonaboutnow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/1971-was-annus-mirabilis-of-rock-album.html\">argued the case for 1971</a>, as he’s more of a James Taylor man than most; Ben Thompson’s Seven Years of Plenty: A Handbook of Irrefutable Pop Greatness plumped for 1991 to 1998 as a relatively recent golden age. Me, I’d go for 1981 as a post-60s pinnacle. BBC4’s Top of the Pops repeats next year will lay 1981 out on a marble slab and give me the chance to work out whether I’m just biased or whether it was a true golden age – I was 16, after all, and

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-&quot;Fame&quot; David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called &quot;ambient&quot; – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice.

falling into the wrong hands.” So begins Music for the Jilted Generation, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/01/electronicmusic.alexispetridis\">Prodigy</a>’s fab second LP. See, seven consecutive hits and a gold debut album aren’t enough for 23-year-old whiz-kid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/aug/20/popandrock.prodigy\">Liam Howlett</a>. He’s sick and tired of his public image: peerless purveyor of hyper-hyper bubblegum nuttercore for E’d up popkids. Liam wants to be taken seriously; more to the point, he wants to be taken seriously by you, the alternative rock fan. So that’s why he’s used rock guitar in a couple of tracks on the album, and that’s why Jilted is a sort of semi-concept album, with a “heavy” political statement.</p><p>“The Jilted Generation, it’s all the kids who’ve grown up on this supposedly corrupt dance music,” says Liam, in between hacking his lungs out (he’s run down by endless remixing and a recent tour of Australia). “The government are trying to make out the whole scene is bad, and they want to stop everyone going out and having a good time.”</p>","linkText":"The Prodigy's Liam Howlett: 'We do everything we can to stay off the telly'","lastModified":1449678799000,"standfirst":"<p>To mark the Prodigy’s 2015 UK tour, Rock’s Backpages brings you this Melody Maker interview with the band’s frontman.

It’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay\">Coldplay</a>’s biggest-ever headlining gig and he’s speechless. He can see Liam Gallagher standing at the side of the stage. Kylie and Natalie Imbruglia are here too. He looks at his best mates next to him – guitarist Jonny Buckland, drummer Will Champion and bassist Guy Berryman – and wonders if they’re feeling as weird as he is. Then he decides to say the first things that come into his head. He introduces their encore with: “OK then, we’ll do another hour of Travis covers.” Then: “This really is our last song ’cos we’ve got to go off and do coke.” Later, he regrets saying anything at all.</p><p>Within minutes of coming offstage, Coldplay’s dressing room is mobbed. A bodyguard appears and says Liam wants to see them. He lopes, in looking exactly like he does on TV, and says that hearing Yellow made him want to start writing songs again. And the room fills and fills with fans and celebrities until the only people not in it are Coldplay themselves. Outside in the corridor, they use the same words: “odd”, “weird”, “surreal”. As Chris Martin will say more than once, “It’s been a confusing year.”</p>","linkText":"Chris Martin: 'I thought my hair was falling out'","lastModified":1447365817000,"standfirst":"<p>They may be smooth operators now, but Coldplay weren’t always so comfortable with global fame, as demonstrated by this 2001 interview from Select magazine – courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.rocksbackpages.com/\">Rock’s Backpages</a></p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e56j","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/coldplay","url":"/music/coldplay","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Coldplay","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/from-rock-s-backpages","url":"/music/series/from-rock-s-backpages","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"From Rock's Backpages","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/from-rock-s-backpages","description":"<a href=\"http://www.rocksbackpages.com/\">Rock's Backpages</a> is the world's leading collection of vintage music journalism.

Now she has returned with the solo album Venus, full of music that just spilled out of her","body":"<p>Joy Williams had an unusual journey into music, because pop and rock were strangers in the family home when she was growing up in California. Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it. Until one day the teenage Williams went for a meeting with her drama teacher about a play her high school was putting on.</p><p>“I saw this disc and it said, ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jimi-hendrix-biopic-london-1967-changed-sound-for-ever\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/26/jimmy-page-robert-plant-how-we-made-led-zeppelin-iii\">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a>,’” the singer says. “I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘You don’t know who they are?’ ‘No.’ And he said: ‘You need that more than I do.’ And I wore that CD out.” Doors were opened and music flooded in, especially once she got a car and had access to a radio outside the conservative, Christian family home. “The first time I heard the Beatles it was like my brain was melting, in all the right ways. Why have I missed out on hearing this? And I don’t think it was because my parents tried to hide it from me – they just weren’t listening to it.”</p>","linkText":"Joy Williams: What got me through the Civil Wars breakup?

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness.

I was very depressed when I was on tour with them and it stopped me from being able to be a part of anything. Everybody in Odd Future is their own artist, they have their own friends and their own ideas for things, so we all spent quite a lot of time separated. It was not the kind of environment where somebody says: “Hey, I’m gonna get some food – you wanna go?” It was more like, “Oh, so and so went to get some food – damn.

Just play the Destroyer drinking game and you’ll get it, he tells us","body":"<p>Nursing his bottle of beer in a Brighton bar, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/30/dan-bejar-destroyer-poison-season-interview\">Dan Bejar</a> exudes a crumpled, slightly confused air. This is at least partly down to chronic jet lag. He and the rest of the musicians who currently go under the name Destroyer arrived in Europe from Vancouver two days ago, gave what even he describes as a “super-weird” performance at a festival in Paris – “It’s eight hours time difference from Vancouver, we were super out of it” – then played London the following night. This morning, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, their tour bus driver insisted on setting off for Brighton at seven, despite the fact that it’s barely an hour’s drive from the capital and the gig isn’t until 9pm. “We got here at eight,” he blinks. What has he been doing since? “I’m scared to tell you.”</p><p>But there seems more to his manner than the time difference and a lack of sleep. Bejar has been releasing albums under the name Destroyer for nearly 20 years, during which time he’s accumulated vast critical acclaim and, latterly, increasing commercial success. This year’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/destroyer-poison-season-review\">Poison Season</a> made the UK charts – admittedly in their lower reaches, but still an unthinkable state of affairs in the days when his output consisted of lo-fi home recordings with titles borrowed from other people’s songs. He also has a second career as a founder member of the equally acclaimed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Pornographers\">New Pornographers</a>. You’d think he might have got used to the business of being a rock musician by now, but apparently not. “I wasn’t born to this,” he says at one point. “No one believes me, but … I get moments of shock that happen every few months when I’m just like: ‘Is it possible that I’m in showbusiness, that this is my profession? How did that happen?’”</p>","linkText":"Destroyer's Dan Bejar: 'It's embarrassing to make rock music in your 40s'","lastModified":1449828579348,"standfirst":"<p>The Canadian indie polymath has made a much-loved slow burner with this year’s Poison Season LP, but why does he keep switching styles?

But which two acts were they?</p>\n <p>Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler</p>\n <p>Fields of the Nephilim and Gene Loves Jezebel</p>\n <p>Starship and Uriah Heap</p>\n <p>The Wonderstuff and the Lucy Show</p>\n <p>2 In 1983, one rock act took to the stage with a model of Stonehenge. Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Sp&iuml;nal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971. Which of the following racecourses has never hosted it?</p>\n <p>Windsor</p>\n <p>Epsom</p>\n <p>Plumpton</p>\n <p>Kempton Park</p>\n <p>5 Among the acts appearing at the 1972 festival were Genesis. But how much were they paid?</p>\n <p>&pound;30</p>\n <p>&pound;175</p>\n <p>&pound;1,500</p>\n <p>&pound;3,000</p>\n <p>6 What did Donita Sparks of L7 throw at disgruntled audience members in 1992?</p>\n <p>Her bottle of water</p>\n <p>Her guitar</p>\n <p>Her pet labradoodle, Patti</p>\n <p>Her tampon</p>\n <p>7 Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners provoked the crowd into their traditional pastime of throwing bottles in 1999. What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times. But which band has he never appeared at the festival as a member of?</p>\n <p>Them Crooked Vultures</p>\n <p>Nirvana</p>\n <p>Queens of the Stone Age</p>\n <p>Foo Fighters</p>\n <p>10 After the Leeds leg of the festival moved from Temple Newsam to Bramham Park, the owner of the Bramham estate said the extra revenue would enable him to undertake renovations and improvements. Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870292,"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

Perhaps the last thing you need when you’ve arrived there, brain fuddled with jetlag, is a conversation with Damon Albarn in full manic flow. One minute he’s talking about refusing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">leave the stage after a five-hour gig</a> with Africa Express (“Am I addicted to work?

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1448461550000,"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

Clapton once described Johnson as, &quot;the most important blues singer that ever lived&quot;. The recordings that Johnson made between 1936 and 1937, collected in two volumes entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Delta-Blues-Singers-Robert-Johnson/dp/B000023ZO5\" title=\"\">King of the Delta Blues Singers</a>, not only mark the apogee of the blues form, they stand among the most influential recordings of all time. Johnson's songs come at the listener with such combustible force that they sound for all the world like the very first rock'n'roll recordings. In the years following his death in 1938, Johnson's story was reshaped as myth, largely thanks to the wonderfully daft notion that he'd sold his soul to the devil in order to master his guitar and play the blues. The myth endures but the extraordinary power of his work has ensured that the music effortlessly transcends the myth. </p><p></p>","linkText":"Robert Johnson revelation tells us to put the brakes on the blues","lastModified":1400538662000,"standfirst":"We've been listening to the immortal 'King of the Delta Blues' at the wrong speed, but now we can hear him as he intended","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2h9dy","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/blues","url":"/music/blues","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Blues","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/blues","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/jonwilde","url":"/profile/jonwilde","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Jon Wilde","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonwilde","bio":"<p>Jon Wilde has worked for Melody Maker, Blitz, Loaded, Uncut, the Independent, Esquire, Uncut, Elle, Marie Claire, GQ and is a regular contributor to the Mail on Sunday, the Guardian and Quintessentially.

href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/about-the-show\">Shark Tank</a>, the US version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/dragons-den\">Dragons’ Den</a>. He arrived wearing a giant cartoon headpiece with oversized headphones, like the Homepride man arriving at <a href=\"http://www.fabriclondon.com/\">Fabric</a>. The lights dim, and Lim and three other guys are revealed to be wearing gloves with light-up fingers. They wiggle their hands and the LED colours change. A few minutes later, Lim is offered $1m (&pound;670,000) for a 5% stake in his company. One of the Sharks, Robert Herjavec, tells Lim he’s potentially the best entrepreneur they have had on the show.</p><p>The technology involved in Lim’s gloves has been available for decades, but his success comes from the way he has created, and then capitalised on, a new trend in American EDM culture: gloving, where people go to dance music events and wave light-up gloves in the face of another person. I’ve <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8feThbCdEc\">only seen this on YouTube videos</a> and it looks bizarre, but, Lim tells me: “The videos don’t do it any justice. When you are receiving a glove light show in person, the glover controls your entire field of vision, and the performance is a very personal one-on-one experience.”</p>","linkText":"We’re gloving it:

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/01/kendrick-lamar-good-kid-review\">Good Kid, MAAD City</a>, was a great album: meticulously crafted, weighty, hugely entertaining, a platinum seller that topped critics’ best-of-the-year lists. But it still couldn’t quite prepare you for what he did next. To Pimp a Butterfly was sprawling, anguished, wilfully contrary. It certainly wasn’t the first latter-day album to be compared to black music’s legendary, turmoil-riddled state-of-the-nation addresses – Marvin Gaye’s What’s Goin’ On, Curtis Mayfield’s There’s No Place Like America Today, Sly and The Family Stone’s There’s a Riot Goin’ On. But for once the association didn’t seem like hyperbole. </p><p>Just as Sly Stone’s decision to strip away his music’s bubbling, bright optimism perfectly caught the pessimism of 1971, To Pimp a Butterfly was the right album by the right artist at the right time. Broiling with post-Ferguson anger and despair – “You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture / You’re fucking evil” – complicated and claustrophobic, riddled with disquiet and self-doubt, desperate to work out what the answers might be but unable to come to any real conclusions, any meaningful reaction beyond a scream of horror. </p>","linkText":"Best albums of 2015: No 1 – To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar","lastModified":1450461458000,"standfirst":"<p>The rapper’s knotty and apparently uncommercial album found a mass audience by capturing the mood of its time: bleak, desperate and broiling with anger</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ng-interactive/2015/dec/02/best-albums-of-2015\">See our countdown of the 40 best albums of 2015</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/best-culture-2015\">More on the best culture of 2015</a></li></ul>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fvng","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/best-albums-of-2015","url":"/music/series/best-albums-of-2015","tagType":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Best albums of 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/best-albums-of-2015","description":"The Guardian's top albums of 2015, as voted for by its music writers","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/kendrick-lamar","url":"/music/kendrick-lamar","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Kendrick Lamar","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kendrick-lamar","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/rap","url":"/music/rap","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Rap","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rap","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/hip-hop","url":"/music/hip-hop","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Hip-hop","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hip-hop","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/series/best-culture-2015","url":"/culture/series/best-culture-2015","tagType":"series","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Best culture 2015","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/best-culture-2015","description":"The year's cultural highlights, chosen by the Guardian's writers and critics","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/alexispetridis","url":"/profile/alexispetridis","tagType":"contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Alexis Petridis","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis","twitterHandle":"alexispetridis","bio":"<p>Alexis Petridis is the Guardian's head rock and pop critic and the music editor of GQ magazine.

We hear him, however, in unusual circumstances. Earlier this year, Hvorostovsky was diagnosed with a brain tumour, but has continued singing between courses of treatment.

/></strong>Mainly on my iPhone or computer, with headphones. I’m remarkably hopeless when it comes to hi-fi equipment, despite working so much with a world-leading company in this field. I suppose headphones are better for a life that is almost always on the move – and when I often have to concentrate on something within a very noisy family environment.</p><p><strong>What was the first ever record or CD that you bought? <br /></strong>It was a late-60s compilation of organ music by EMI called The King of Instruments. I went out of my way to learn these pieces as soon as I could, and they are almost etched on my mind: Widor’s Toccata, Bach’s Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, followed by Buxtehude’s Preludium in G minor. In fact I can’t hear Purcell’s Voluntary on the Old 100th without thinking of George Thalben Ball’s slightly clumsy trill at the beginning of the second section.</p>","linkText":"Facing the music:
